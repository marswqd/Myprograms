C ABSTRACT:
C   Simulated annealing is a global optimization method that distinguishes
C   between different local optima. Starting from an initial point, the
C   algorithm takes a step and the function is evaluated. When minimizing a
C   function, any downhill step is accepted and the process repeats from this
C   new point. An uphill step may be accepted. Thus, it can escape from local
C   optima. This uphill decision is made by the Metropolis criteria. As the
C   optimization process proceeds, the length of the steps decline and the
C   algorithm closes in on the global optimum. Since the algorithm makes very
C   few assumptions regarding the function to be optimized, it is quite
C   robust with respect to non-quadratic surfaces. The degree of robustness
C   can be adjusted by the user. In fact, simulated annealing can be used as
C   a local optimizer for difficult functions.
C
C   This implementation of simulated annealing was used in "Global Optimization
C   of Statistical Functions with Simulated Annealing," Goffe, Ferrier and
C   Rogers, Journal of Econometrics, vol. 60, no. 1/2, Jan./Feb. 1994, pp.
C   65-100. Briefly, we found it competitive, if not superior, to multiple
C   restarts of conventional optimization routines for difficult optimization
C   problems.

      PROGRAM SIMANN
C  This file is an example of the Corana et al. simulated annealing
C  algorithm for multimodal and robust optimization as implemented
C  and modified by Goffe, Ferrier and Rogers. Counting the above line
C  ABSTRACT as 1, the routine itself (SA), with its supplementary
C  routines, is on lines 232-990. A multimodal example from Judge et al.
C  (FCN) is on lines 150-231. The rest of this file (lines 1-149) is a
C  driver routine with values appropriate for the Judge example. Thus, this
C  example is ready to run.
C
C  To understand the algorithm, the documentation for SA on lines 236-
C  484 should be read along with the parts of the paper that describe
C  simulated annealing. Then the following lines will then aid the user
C  in becomming proficient with this implementation of simulated
C  annealing.
C
C  Learning to use SA:
C      Use the sample function from Judge with the following suggestions
C  to get a feel for how SA works. When you've done this, you should be
C  ready to use it on most any function with a fair amount of expertise.
C    1. Run the program as is to make sure it runs okay. Take a look at
C       the intermediate output and see how it optimizes as temperature
C       (T) falls. Notice how the optimal point is reached and how
C       falling T reduces VM.
C    2. Look through the documentation to SA so the following makes a
C       bit of sense. In line with the paper, it shouldn't be that hard
C       to figure out. The core of the algorithm is described on pp. 68-70
C       and on pp. 94-95. Also see Corana et al. pp. 264-9.
C    3. To see how it selects points and makes decisions about uphill
C       and downhill moves, set IPRINT = 3 (very detailed intermediate
C       output) and MAXEVL = 100 (only 100 function evaluations to limit
C       output).
C    4. To see the importance of different temperatures, try starting
C       with a very low one (say T = 10E-5). You'll see (i) it never
C       escapes from the local optima (in annealing terminology, it
C       quenches) & (ii) the step length (VM) will be quite small. This
C       is a key part of the algorithm: as temperature (T) falls, step
C       length does too. In a minor point here, note how VM is quickly
C       reset from its initial value. Thus, the input VM is not very
C       important. This is all the more reason to examine VM once the
C       algorithm is underway.
C    5. To see the effect of different parameters and their effect on
C       the speed of the algorithm, try RT = .95 & RT = .1. Notice the
C       vastly different speed for optimization. Also try NT = 20. Note
C       that this sample function is quite easy to optimize, so it will
C       tolerate big changes in these parameters. RT and NT are the
C       parameters one should adjust to modify the runtime of the
C       algorithm and its robustness.
C    6. Try constraining the algorithm with either LB or UB.

C  Version: 3.2
C  Date: 1/22/94.
C  Differences compared to Version 2.0:
C     1. If a trial is out of bounds, a point is randomly selected
C        from LB(i) to UB(i). Unlike in version 2.0, this trial is
C        evaluated and is counted in acceptances and rejections.
C        All corresponding documentation was changed as well.
C  Differences compared to Version 3.0:
C     1. If VM(i) > (UB(i) - LB(i)), VM is set to UB(i) - LB(i).
C        The idea is that if T is high relative to LB & UB, most
C        points will be accepted, causing VM to rise. But, in this
C        situation, VM has little meaning; particularly if VM is
C        larger than the acceptable region. Setting VM to this size
C        still allows all parts of the allowable region to be selected.
C  Differences compared to Version 3.1:
C     1. Test made to see if the initial temperature is positive.
C     2. WRITE statements prettied up.
C     3. References to paper updated.

C  Synopsis:
C  This routine implements the continuous simulated annealing global
C  optimization algorithm described in Corana et al.'s article
C  "Minimizing Multimodal Functions of Continuous Variables with the
C  "Simulated Annealing" Algorithm" in the September 1987 (vol. 13,
C  no. 3, pp. 262-280) issue of the ACM Transactions on Mathematical
C  Software.
C
C  A very quick (perhaps too quick) overview of SA:
C     SA tries to find the global optimum of an N dimensional function.
C  It moves both up and downhill and as the optimization process
C  proceeds, it focuses on the most promising area.
C     To start, it randomly chooses a trial point within the step length
C  VM (a vector of length N) of the user selected starting point. The
C  function is evaluated at this trial point and its value is compared
C  to its value at the initial point.
C     In a maximization problem, all uphill moves are accepted and the
C  algorithm continues from that trial point. Downhill moves may be
C  accepted; the decision is made by the Metropolis criteria. It uses T
C  (temperature) and the size of the downhill move in a probabilistic
C  manner. The smaller T and the size of the downhill move are, the more
C  likely that move will be accepted. If the trial is accepted, the
C  algorithm moves on from that point. If it is rejected, another point
C  is chosen instead for a trial evaluation.
C     Each element of VM periodically adjusted so that half of all
C  function evaluations in that direction are accepted.
C     A fall in T is imposed upon the system with the RT variable by
C  T(i+1) = RT*T(i) where i is the ith iteration. Thus, as T declines,
C  downhill moves are less likely to be accepted and the percentage of
C  rejections rise. Given the scheme for the selection for VM, VM falls.
C  Thus, as T declines, VM falls and SA focuses upon the most promising
C  area for optimization.
C
C  The importance of the parameter T:
C     The parameter T is crucial in using SA successfully. It influences
C  VM, the step length over which the algorithm searches for optima. For
C  a small intial T, the step length may be too small; thus not enough
C  of the function might be evaluated to find the global optima. The user
C  should carefully examine VM in the intermediate output (set IPRINT =
C  1) to make sure that VM is appropriate. The relationship between the
C  initial temperature and the resulting step length is function
C  dependent.
C     To determine the starting temperature that is consistent with
C  optimizing a function, it is worthwhile to run a trial run first. Set
C  RT = 1.5 and T = 1.0. With RT > 1.0, the temperature increases and VM
C  rises as well. Then select the T that produces a large enough VM.

C  As far as possible, the parameters here have the same name as in
C  the description of the algorithm on pp. 266-8 of Corana et al.
C
C  In this description, SP is single precision, DP is double precision,
C  INT is integer, L is logical and (N) denotes an array of length n.
C  Thus, DP(N) denotes a double precision array of length n.
C
C  Input Parameters:
C    Note: The suggested values generally come from Corana et al. To
C          drastically reduce runtime, see Goffe et al., pp. 90-1 for
C          suggestions on choosing the appropriate RT and NT.
C    N - Number of variables in the function to be optimized. (INT)
C    X - The starting values for the variables of the function to be
C        optimized. (DP(N))
C    MAX - Denotes whether the function should be maximized or
C          minimized. A true value denotes maximization while a false
C          value denotes minimization. Intermediate output (see IPRINT)
C          takes this into account. (L)
C    RT - The temperature reduction factor. The value suggested by
C         Corana et al. is .85. See Goffe et al. for more advice. (DP)
C    EPS - Error tolerance for termination. If the final function
C          values from the last neps temperatures differ from the
C          corresponding value at the current temperature by less than
C          EPS and the final function value at the current temperature
C          differs from the current optimal function value by less than
C          EPS, execution terminates and IER = 0 is returned. (EP)
C    NS - Number of cycles. After NS*N function evaluations, each
C         element of VM is adjusted so that approximately half of
C         all function evaluations are accepted. The suggested value
C         is 20. (INT)
C    NT - Number of iterations before temperature reduction. After
C         NT*NS*N function evaluations, temperature (T) is changed
C         by the factor RT. Value suggested by Corana et al. is
C         MAX(100, 5*N). See Goffe et al. for further advice. (INT)
C    NEPS - Number of final function values used to decide upon termi-
C           nation. See EPS. Suggested value is 4. (INT)
C    MAXEVL - The maximum number of function evaluations. If it is
C             exceeded, IER = 1. (INT)
C    LB - The lower bound for the allowable solution variables. (DP(N))
C    UB - The upper bound for the allowable solution variables. (DP(N))
C         If the algorithm chooses X(I) .LT. LB(I) or X(I) .GT. UB(I),
C         I = 1, N, a point is from inside is randomly selected. This
C         This focuses the algorithm on the region inside UB and LB.
C         Unless the user wishes to concentrate the search to a par-
C         ticular region, UB and LB should be set to very large positive
C         and negative values, respectively. Note that the starting
C         vector X should be inside this region. Also note that LB and
C         UB are fixed in position, while VM is centered on the last
C         accepted trial set of variables that optimizes the function.
C    C - Vector that controls the step length adjustment. The suggested
C        value for all elements is 2.0. (DP(N))
C    IPRINT - controls printing inside SA. (INT)
C             Values: 0 - Nothing printed.
C                     1 - Function value for the starting value and
C                         summary results before each temperature
C                         reduction. This includes the optimal
C                         function value found so far, the total
C                         number of moves (broken up into uphill,
C                         downhill, accepted and rejected), the
C                         number of out of bounds trials, the
C                         number of new optima found at this
C                         temperature, the current optimal X and
C                         the step length VM. Note that there are
C                         N*NS*NT function evalutations before each
C                         temperature reduction. Finally, notice is
C                         is also given upon achieveing the termination
C                         criteria.
C                     2 - Each new step length (VM), the current optimal
C                         X (XOPT) and the current trial X (X). This
C                         gives the user some idea about how far X
C                         strays from XOPT as well as how VM is adapting
C                         to the function.
C                     3 - Each function evaluation, its acceptance or
C                         rejection and new optima. For many problems,
C                         this option will likely require a small tree
C                         if hard copy is used. This option is best
C                         used to learn about the algorithm. A small
C                         value for MAXEVL is thus recommended when
C                         using IPRINT = 3.
C             Suggested value: 1
C             Note: For a given value of IPRINT, the lower valued
C                   options (other than 0) are utilized.
C    ISEED1 - The first seed for the random number generator RANMAR.
C             0 .LE. ISEED1 .LE. 31328. (INT)
C    ISEED2 - The second seed for the random number generator RANMAR.
C             0 .LE. ISEED2 .LE. 30081. Different values for ISEED1
C             and ISEED2 will lead to an entirely different sequence
C             of trial points and decisions on downhill moves (when
C             maximizing). See Goffe et al. on how this can be used
C             to test the results of SA. (INT)
C
C  Input/Output Parameters:
C    T - On input, the initial temperature. See Goffe et al. for advice.
C        On output, the final temperature. (DP)
C    VM - The step length vector. On input it should encompass the
C         region of interest given the starting value X. For point
C         X(I), the next trial point is selected is from X(I) - VM(I)
C         to  X(I) + VM(I). Since VM is adjusted so that about half
C         of all points are accepted, the input value is not very
C         important (i.e. is the value is off, SA adjusts VM to the
C         correct value). (DP(N))
C
C  Output Parameters:
C    XOPT - The variables that optimize the function. (DP(N))
C    FOPT - The optimal value of the function. (DP)
C    NACC - The number of accepted function evaluations. (INT)
C    NFCNEV - The total number of function evaluations. In a minor
C             point, note that the first evaluation is not used in the
C             core of the algorithm; it simply initializes the
C             algorithm. (INT).
C    NOBDS - The total number of trial function evaluations that
C            would have been out of bounds of LB and UB. Note that
C            a trial point is randomly selected between LB and UB.
C            (INT)
C    IER - The error return number. (INT)
C          Values: 0 - Normal return; termination criteria achieved.
C                  1 - Number of function evaluations (NFCNEV) is
C                      greater than the maximum number (MAXEVL).
C                  2 - The starting value (X) is not inside the
C                      bounds (LB and UB).
C                  3 - The initial temperature is not positive.
C                  99 - Should not be seen; only used internally.
C
C  Work arrays that must be dimensioned in the calling routine:
C       RWK1 (DP(NEPS))  (FSTAR in SA)
C       RWK2 (DP(N))     (XP    "  " )
C       IWK  (INT(N))    (NACP  "  " )
C
C  Required Functions (included):
C    EXPREP - Replaces the function EXP to avoid under- and overflows.
C             It may have to be modified for non IBM-type main-
C             frames. (DP)
C    RMARIN - Initializes the random number generator RANMAR.
C    RANMAR - The actual random number generator. Note that
C             RMARIN must run first (SA does this). It produces uniform
C             random numbers on [0,1]. These routines are from
C             Usenet's comp.lang.fortran. For a reference, see
C             "Toward a Universal Random Number Generator"
C             by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman, Florida State
C             University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987).
C             It was later modified by F. James and published in
C             "A Review of Pseudo-random Number Generators." For
C             further information, contact stuart@ads.com. These
C             routines are designed to be portable on any machine
C             with a 24-bit or more mantissa. I have found it produces
C             identical results on a IBM 3081 and a Cray Y-MP.
C
C  Required Subroutines (included):
C    PRTVEC - Prints vectors.
C    PRT1 ... PRT10 - Prints intermediate output.
C    FCN - Function to be optimized. The form is

C            INTEGER N
C            DOUBLE PRECISION  X(N), F

C  Machine Specific Features:
C    1. EXPREP may have to be modified if used on non-IBM type main-

C       some machines.
C    3. RMARIN and RANMAR are designed to be protable; they should not

C  taken out since ivec isn't used. With these exceptions, all following
